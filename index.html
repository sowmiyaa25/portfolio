      <h2>About Me</h2>
       <div class="project-card">
      <p>
      I am an Aeronautical Engineering student with a strong inclination toward space systems, 
      technology, and structured knowledge communication. My academic foundation lies in aerospace 
      engineering, where I develop analytical thinking, problem-solving ability, and a systems-level 
      understanding of complex mechanisms.Alongside my core engineering background, I actively build 
      skills in programming and technical tools, allowing me to approach problems with both engineering 
      logic and computational clarity. This combination enables me to work comfortably at the intersection
      of engineering concepts and digital solutions.I also have a deep interest in technical writing and 
      documentation, where I focus on transforming complex scientific and engineering ideas into clear, 
      accessible, and well-structured content. I enjoy explaining concepts for learners, non-specialists, 
      and interdisciplinary audiences, ensuring accuracy without sacrificing readability.Beyond technology, 
      I am intellectually drawn to subjects such as space science, earth systems, oceanology, history, 
      philosophy, and travel. These interests shape my perspective, helping me observe systems—natural or 
      engineered—with curiosity, patience, and depth.I aspire to contribute in roles that value clarity 
      of thought, structured communication, and interdisciplinary understanding—where engineering, technology, 
      and meaningful knowledge exchange come together.
