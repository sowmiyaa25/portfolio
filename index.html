      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I am an Aeronautical Engineering student with a strong interest in space systems, technical documentation, 
      and scientific communication. Alongside my core aerospace background, I create clear, structured technical content 
      that simplifies complex concepts for learners and non-specialist audiences. My work reflects a balance of engineering 
      thinking, curiosity across science and humanities, and precision in communication. I am driven by continuous learning 
      and by the ability to translate knowledge into meaningful, accessible insights.
