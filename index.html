        <h3>Aeronautical Engineering Student <h3>
       </h3>Exploring Space, Systems & Thought</h3>
        <p>
            I am an Aeronautical Engineering student with a growing passion for technology and innovation. While my core background is in aerospace, I am also building strong foundations in programming (Java, HTML, SQL, GitHub) to expand my problem-solving abilities beyond traditional engineering.
            My interest lies in applying analytical thinking and structured coding skills to complex systems, whether in aviation, software, or interdisciplinary fields. I believe that technology and aerospace are deeply interconnected, and I aim to bridge this gap by combining my engineering knowledge 
            with IT expertise. I thrive in environments that challenge me to adapt, learn quickly, and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects. Whether it is working on aircraft systems or coding solutions, my focus remains on continuous learning and delivering value.
